Task 1 of the Mechanical Engineering path:

In Task 1.1, I collected the parts of the original robot and connected them using Cinema 4D.

In task 1.2 and task 1.3, I modified the robot and redesigned the base also using Cinema 4D.

The modifications I made are:

1-Creating a cylindrical shaped body for the robot to make it look more modern and stable.

2-Covering the back of the screen to avoid having any visible wires and to avoid any damage to the robot or injuries to the surroundings caused by some of the components not being covered.

3-Speaker under the screen facing the desired person.
